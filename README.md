# LLM Model Exploration and RAG structure

## Overview
This repository presents a series of notebooks detailing the exploration and evaluation of various LLM models, focusing on metadata extraction, multilingual processing, comparative analysis, and performance evaluation.

### Notebooks Description:

#### 1. Metadata Extraction (`0-meta-data-exctract.ipynb`)
Delve into the technicalities of extracting metadata from PDF files, analyzing document structures, and retrieving essential details like authorship, publication date, and content overview.

#### 2. Language Model Chat with Turkish Document (`1-llm_chat_with_turkish_document.ipynb`)
Showcases the interaction with Turkish-language documents, demonstrating the capabilities of language models in understanding and generating contextually relevant responses in Turkish.

#### 3. Comparing Language Models for RAG (`2-compare_llms_for_rag.ipynb`)
This notebook presents a detailed comparison of four different language models in the context of retrieval-augmented generation, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in various NLP tasks.

#### 4. Evaluating Results with GPT-4 (`3-evaluate-results-with-gpt4.ipynb`)
Focuses on the evaluation metrics and methods used to assess the output of GPT-4, providing insights into the model's text generation quality and coherence.

## Prerequisites
To use these notebooks, you will need:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for interactive execution and visualization
- `PyPDF2` for PDF processing and metadata extraction
